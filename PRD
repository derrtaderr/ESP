ESP Domain Analyzer: Micro SaaS PRD
1. Problem
Email marketers and sales professionals often struggle with optimizing their outreach campaigns due to a lack of information about their leads' email service providers (ESPs). This results in lower deliverability rates, reduced open rates, and ultimately, less effective email campaigns. There is a need for a simple, efficient tool that can quickly analyze a large number of email addresses (up to 1000 leads per upload) and categorize them by their ESP, specifically focusing on Microsoft and Google domains.

2. High Level Approach
We will develop a web-based micro SaaS application that allows users to upload a list of email addresses (up to 1000 leads) and automatically categorizes them based on their email service provider, focusing primarily on identifying Microsoft and Google domains. The tool will provide instant results, enabling users to segment their email lists effectively for improved targeting and deliverability.

[NEW/UPDATED]
An additional requirement is to add a new column in the analyzed CSV output. For each email address, the tool will add a column that indicates the ESP category (e.g., "Google," "Microsoft," or "Other").

3. Narrative
Sarah, a marketing manager at a B2B SaaS company, has a list of 1000 potential leads she wants to reach out to via email. She knows that tailoring her approach based on the recipient's email service provider can significantly improve her campaign's success rate. Sarah visits the ESP Domain Analyzer website, uploads her CSV file containing the email addresses, and within seconds receives:

A breakdown of which emails are associated with Microsoft domains
Which emails are Google domains
Which belong to other providers
[NEW/UPDATED] A new column in her uploaded file that specifies the identified ESP next to each email address.
With this information, Sarah can now customize her email content and sending strategy for each segment, leading to higher open rates and more effective communication with her prospects.

4. Goals
4.1 Metrics
Achieve 1000 registered users within the first 3 months of launch
Process 1 million email addresses within the first month of operation
Maintain a 99.9% uptime for the service
Achieve a user satisfaction rating of 4.5/5 or higher
Convert 10% of free trial users to paid subscribers within the first 6 months
4.2 Impact Sizing Model
Assuming an average of 500 email addresses analyzed per user per month:

1000 users * 500 emails = 500,000 emails processed monthly
If 20% of these emails lead to improved targeting, resulting in a 5% increase in conversion rates:
100,000 better-targeted emails * 5% improvement = 5,000 additional conversions
Estimating an average deal size of $100:
5,000 additional conversions * $100 = $500,000 potential additional revenue for our users monthly
5. Non-goals
Providing detailed information about ESPs beyond Microsoft and Google
Offering email validation or verification services
Integrating directly with email marketing platforms
Providing email content suggestions or templates
Analyzing email addresses in real-time as they are typed
6. Solution Alignment
